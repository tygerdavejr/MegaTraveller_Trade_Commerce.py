Automating Trade and Commerce for the MegaTraveller game

MegaTraveller (MT) is a science fiction role-play game that uses a lot of charts and randomness to execute gameplay functions.  I've always been interested in the economic concept of the game, having been influenced heavily by C.J. Cherryh's Merchanter's Luck book.  I'd always wanted to automate the Trade and Commerce section.

This initial attempt will require the user to input the necessary values needed to execute the processes, but some time in the future I would like to include a database of star systems, allowing the user to select destinations from a map.
